# Real-Time Location Tracking with Google Maps
This project is a real-time location tracking system built with **Node.js**, **EJS**, **Google Maps CDN**, and **Socket.IO**. The system allows multiple users to share their live locations on a common map, making it ideal for tracking purposes.

## Features

- **Google Maps Integration:** Visualizes real-time user locations using the Google Maps API.
- **Real-Time Communication:** Utilizes Socket.IO for instant updates across connected clients.
- **Multi-User Support:** Each connected user is represented by a distinct marker on the map, with self-location highlighted.
- **Dynamic UI Rendering:** The front-end is rendered using EJS templates for dynamic content delivery.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend server and Socket.IO setup.
- **Express.js**: Handles routing and middleware.
- **EJS**: Renders dynamic templates for the front-end.
- **Google Maps API (via CDN)**: Provides the map interface and marker functionality.
- **Socket.IO**: Enables real-time bi-directional communication.
